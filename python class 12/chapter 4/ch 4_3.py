'''Tuple'''
# #Major difference b/w tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable and lists are mutable
# a=(1,3,4,65,7,8,1)
# ab=(3)#will be considered as a number, not tuple
# av=(3,)#right way to declare a tuple
# print(a)

# # tuple methods
# he=(1,3,5,45,243,3,67,5,4,3,3,3,3)
# print(he.count(3))#returns no. of occurences of 3
# print(he.index(3))#gives the index of first occurence of 3
